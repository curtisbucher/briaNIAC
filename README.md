# briaNIAC
This repository contains all the software for my homebrew brainf*ck computer, the braiNIAC. As of right now, the software is responsible for downloading a file from a PC to the braiNIAC's EEPROM, through a connected arduino. The software is written in Python on the PC end, and in Processing (C) on the Arduino end.

For a more detailed overview on the braiNIAC, it's hardware, and my progress on the project, checkout
